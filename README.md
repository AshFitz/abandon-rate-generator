<h1>The Abandon Rate Generator</h1>

<p>Call center abandonment is a critical KPI, that must be closely monitored at all times. Abandon rate is the percentage of customers that abandon their call before speaking to a call center representative. This is calculated by dividing the number of abandonded calls by the total number of calls received. 
</p>

## Project Purpose
<p>This app is not intended to be used by multiple users at one time. This app was created for an individual call centre to track their perfomance by generating their abandon rate. It allows a user to generate the abandon rate as many times as they please. This app is available to any member of staff within the call center. Tracking this KPI will assist in adhering to SLA's, creating an overall better experience for the customer and improving the call centers performance. We also offer the user an option to view the spreadsheet for further data analysis.
